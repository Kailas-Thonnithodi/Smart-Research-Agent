       "In 2025, Nvidia has introduced several significant AI innovations across hardware, software, and collaborative initiatives. A notable advancement is the Rubin microarchitecture, set for mass production in late 2025 and availability in early 2026. This architecture boasts a GPU capable of 50 petaflops in FP4 performance, a substantial increase from its predecessor, Blackwell. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled the Feynman microarchitecture, named after physicist Richard Feynman, with a planned release in 2028. Feynman will utilize High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and is being developed using Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs to accelerate its design.

Cosmos integrates generative models, tokenizers, and a video processing pipeline to enable AI systems to predict and evaluate multiple future scenarios, facilitating better decision-making in complex environments. This platform has been adopted by leading robotics and automotive companies, including Uber. ([blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ces-2025-jensen-huang/?utm_source=openai))\n",

       "In terms of collaborative efforts, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to significantly enhance the AI firm's computing capacity, particularly supporting the development of ChatGPT. This investment includes building at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia-powered AI data centers, with the first gigawatt to be installed in the second half of 2026. This initiative complements OpenAI's broader collaborations with companies like Microsoft, Oracle, and SoftBank, which have previously pledged additional investments for AI infrastructure.
